### Hi friends!

I'm Ana (she/her), a software engineer and a technical communicator.

🕊️ Approaching work human-first: building with empathy, while growing and uplifting people around me.

🫀 Love clarity, structure, accessible and tasty designs. Can rant about knowledge-sharing in engineering for hours.

🛠️ Generalist affinity: all tools are cool, and the ones I prefer are the ones that are right for the job. ~~And TypeScript 😭~~

🏝️ Outside of work I write music, paint boardgame miniatures and hang out with my cat Borsch. When the weather is nice I climb hills or look at waterfalls.
