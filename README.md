### Hi there 👋

I am Ana, a web developer in the making 👩‍💻  and a muso 🧑‍🎤. [Check out my band!](https://renelophus.bandcamp.com/)

🤓 I'm currently doing a Full Stack Development bootcamp at Coder Academy, Melbourne. 

🤖 I'm passionate about technology, bringing positive change to the future, as well as increasing diversity and inclusivity in tech.

🐣 So far I'm at my baby steps stage of learning, and I think I could greatly benefit from mentorship, so if you're looking for a mentee, hit me up!

🏝️ In my free time I sing, hang out with my cats, watch movies or play games. When the wheather is nice I like go to the beach and make sand animals.

🕊️ If you have any questions/propositions or just want to say hi, feel free [send me an email](mailto:a.lastovirya@gmail.com).
